README:
this porject's perpose is optimize double-ring patch antenna using GA.
how to figure out which one is good? "lower S11 is batter"

Like the lyric "for the fist time in forever" I've made this code. 
apparently i'm not code-virgin now. :)
and all code was scraped together form example on the MathWorks.
Especially, GA(Genetic Algorithm) and PatchAntenna.
so if you wanna ask License, go MathWorks and ask them.
